ISSN-L-resolver
===============

An **ISSN** is a standard public [opaque identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_identifier) for [journals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodical_publication), assigned by the [ISSN-ORG authority](http://www.issn.org). It's most frequent use, is to be a short alias name for the [systematic name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_name) of the journal, uniquely identifying  the publication content (*ISSN-L*) or specific [media type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_(communication)) of the publication (other ISSNs like *e-ISSN* and *p-ISSN*).

The **ISSN-L resolver** converts, with SQL, any ISSN to it's correspondent [ISSN-L](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISSN#Linking_ISSN), using a  lightweight structure,

  ````sql
   CREATE TABLE lib.issn_l (
      issn integer not null primary key, issn_l integer not null
    );
    -- see "N2Ns" service, about need for indexes.
  ````

The core of the *ISSN-L resolver* solution is a SQL script writed for PostgreSQL, in PL/pgSQL language. It  offer also funcions to format and to validate string-ISSNs of the front-end, webservices or back-services.

## Synopsis ##
The project have 3 issues:

 1. A PHP script that converts the (updated) "ISSN to ISSN-L" TXT table, into a SQL table of integers (ISSN numbers without the *check digit*).

 2. The `lib.sql`, that offers a resolver and all king of util convertion and ISSN handling, inclung *check digit* reconstruction.

 3. An Apache2 aplication (here with a PHP example) to expose the resolution into a simple and friendly set of web-service endpoints.

## Populating ##

In order to have access to the txt data of correspondence ISSN/ISSN-L,  fill the form on ISSN-ORG website:

 http://www.issn.org/services/online-services/access-to-issn-l-table/
   
then, you download a 18Mb zip file, 

     issnltables.zip

but only a half (9Mb) is about "ISSN to ISSN-L" table, and, at SQL database, with numbers as integers (4 bytes), you can use less space.
With `issnltables2sql.php` you can convert the file into SQL and then run `psql` to populate.

### Instructions for populating ###

 1. unzip issnltables.zip in a "issnltables"  folder
 2. test at terminal with `$ php issnltables2sql.php`
 3. run all with your database: `$ php issnltables2sql.php all | psql -h localhost -U postgres base`
 4. if you not using `lib` schema, create it at your database, `CREATE SCHEMA lib`
 5. install the lib: `$ psql -h localhost -U postgres base < lib.sql`
 6. if not use for another thing, `rm -r issnltables` and `rm issnltables.zip`

## Resolving ##
The "ISSN resolver" is a simple information retrivial service that returns integer or canonical ISSNs as response. 

### With SQL ###

Use the function `lib.issnl_n2c()` ... Examples:

```sql
  SELECT lib.issnl_n2c(8755999);     -- returns 8755999
  SELECT lib.issnl_n2c('8755-9994'); -- returns 8755999
  SELECT lib.issnl_n2c(115);         -- returns 67
  SELECT lib.issn_cast(lib.issnl_n2c(8755999)) -- returns 8755-9994
  SELECT lib.issn_cast(lib.issnl_n2c(115))     -- returns 0000-0671
```
### With webservice ###
Standard (binding) operations for an URN resolution, inspired in the RFC2169 jargon,

* Standard resolution = to retrieve catalographic information of the journal. Is beyond the scope of this project, but is the recommended endpoint.
* N2C = return the canonic (preferred) URN of a URN. ISSN-L is the "canonic" of a "free ISSN".
* N2U = return the URL of a URN. The main URL of the ISSN's journal. 
* N2Ns = return the set of liked ISSNs of the journal (specified by any of its ISSNs).
* N2Us = return all the URLs of the ISSN's journal.
* ...

At a webservice's endpoint, ex. `http://ws.myDomain/issn-resolver`, use `xws.` for XML-webservice, `jws.` for JSON-webservice.

**Standard [endpoint](http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl20/#Endpoint) rule syntax**:

```
    http://<subdomain> "." <domain> "/" <query>
      <subdomain> =  [<catalog-name> "."] <ws-format> 
      <ws-format> = "tws" | "hws" | "jws" | "xws" | "ws"
      <query>     = <urn> | <operation> "/" <urn>
      <urn>       = "urn:" <urn-schema> ":" <urn-value> | <urn-value>
```

that webservice endpoint's are "short URLs", like this request in a "journal" catalog, `http://jou.tws.myExample.org/n2n/123456`.

Another option, if you can not change subdomain, is a not-so-short-URL, with the same information in the path part of [URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator):

```
    http://"ws." <domain> "/" <query>
      <query>     = <io-format> "/" <operation> "/" <urn>
      <operation> = <io-format> "." <catalog-name> "." <op-name> | <io-format> "." <op-name>
      <io-format> = "text" | "html" | "json" | "xml" | "auto"
      <catalog-name>  = "jou" | "art" | "issue" | "auto"
      <op-name>   = "N2N" | "N2Ns" | "N2C" | "N2Cs" | "N2U" | "N2Us" | "isN"| "isC" | "info"
      <urn>       = "urn:" <urn-schema> ":" <urn-value> | <urn-value>
```

any other bigger or complex parameter, must use HTTP POST, or send GET parameters in an usual query-URL (using ex. the [OpenURL standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenURL)).

The alone `<urn-value>` is for local default URN schemas, when exist (ex. a subdomain where only ISSN is used, not need to express all "urn:issn:" prefix). The `<operation> "/" <urn>` option is usual in contexts where is difficult to solicitate more `<specific-name>` subdomains for each operation.

The `<ws-format>` convention is
 * "h" for HTML format, in a "human readable" usual context.
 * "x" for XML format in a WSDL2 webservice context.
 * "j" for JSON format, in a JOSN-RPC or similar context.
 * "t" for old *MIME text/plain* output format, a simplification of the XML output, for tests and terminal debuging.

The "ws" `<ws-format>` is a "web-service catalog describer" endpoint, describing each endpoint, by some format (in a `/html`, `/txt`, `/json`, or `/xml` format).

Example: `http://issn.jws.example.org/1234-9223` returns the default operation for the standard query, that is something like a [catalog card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_catalog#Catalog_card) of the corresponding journal.

**Standard operations**: a [WSDL file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WSDL#Example_WSDL_file) describes services as collections of network endpoints, so, in the same intention, this document describes a set of interoperable endpoints focusing on the handling of ISSN-URNs. As suggested by the [old IETF's RFC-2169](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2169), some typical *"ISSN resolution"* services can be offered, in response to the `<query>`,

 * *N2N*: the *ISSN-L* of the input. See SQL `lib.issnl_get()`.
 * *N2Ns*: all the *ISSN*s grouped by a ISSN-L associated with the input. See SQL `lib.issnl_getall()`.
 * *N2U*: the "journal's official URL", where "official" is in the context of the webservice server entity. No implementation here, only an illustrative operation.
 * *N2Us*: all the "journal's URLs", when exist more than one. No implementation here, only an illustrative operation.
 * *isN*: check if a query string is a valid ISSN (registered in the database).
 * *isC*: like *isN* but also checking format. See SQL `lib.issn_check()`.
 * *info*: the *card catalog* of the object pointed by the URN.
  
The letters in these *standard operation names* are used in the following sense:

 * "C": the canonic URN string (the "official string" and unique identifier);
 * "N": URN, *canonical* or *"reference URN"* (a simplified non-ambiguous version of the canonical one);
 * "U": URL;
 * "is": "isX" stands "is a kind of X" or "is really a X";
 * "2": stands "to", for convertion services. 

These basic ISSN resolution operations, solves most of the commom interoperability problems. Of course, any other simple (1 operand) operation can be add as new `op-name` or a (2 or more operands) as a complete URL.

#### Endpoint URL examples
URL example and description:

 * `http://jou.tws.myExample.org/n2n/123456` - Context="journal", io-format="text", operation="n2n" (resolve name replaying name), URN=123456 (using default URN-schema=issn and reference-URN). 
 * `http://ws.myExample.org/text.jou.n2n/123456` - idem above, but with context and format at path. 
 * `http://ws.myExample.org/text.auto/0123-456X` - similar to above, but with default operation (`info`) and default (or auto-detect) URN-schema.
 * ...
 * `http://jou.tws.myExample.org/n2n/urn:issn:123456` - ...
 * ...
 * `http://jou.tws.myExample.org/?cmd=n2n&q=urn:issn:123456` - ...
 * ...
 
## Implementations ##
Some notes about each specific implementation.

### PostgreSQL library ###
...

### Apache2 .htaccess ###
On the VirtualHost's `DocumentRoot` directory of the mapped `ServerName` (`<subdomain>.<domain>`), add the folowing `.htaccess` file, for an `<operation> "/" <urn>` endpoint syntax option:

```
RewriteEngine on

# If requested url is an existing file or folder, don't touch it
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d [OR]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f
RewriteRule . - [L]

# If we reach here, this means it's not a file or folder, we can rewrite...
RewriteRule ^(?:urn:(issn):)?([0-9][\d\-]*X?)$                           index.php?cmd=std&urn_schema=$1&q=$2 [L]
RewriteRule ^(n2ns?|n2us?|isn|isc)/(?:urn:(issn):)?([0-9][\d\-]*X?)$     index.php?cmd=$1&urn_schema=$2&q=$3 [L]
