ISSN-L-resolver
===============

With PostgreSQL, converts any ISSN to the correspondent ISSN-L

In order to have access to the table of correspondence ISSN/ISSN-L,  fill the form on ISSN-ORG website:
   http://www.issn.org/services/online-services/access-to-issn-l-table/
then, you download a 18Mb zip file, 
  issnltables.zip
but only a half (9Mb) is about "ISSN to ISSN-L" table, and as integers, you can use less space.

The resolver solution also offer PL/pgSQL funcions to format and to validate ISSNs.
